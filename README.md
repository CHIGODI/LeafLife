# LEAF LIFE

<h1>Project Description</h1>
<img src="./Resources/leaf life logo.png">
<p>
    LeafLife is a web app designed for small-scale organic farmers to help them manage their gardens and document their sustainable farming practices. Users can create and track multiple gardens, monitor crop growth from planting to harvest, and log organic farming activities like natural fertilization, pest control, and crop rotation.
    As more people turn to organic gardening, LeafLife provides a user-friendly web platform to manage small gardens while promoting sustainable farming practices.

## Little Background:
<p>
    When Julius isn’t coding,  he’s tending a small vegetable garden in his neighborhood where he grows fresh produce for his family. He developed an Excel sheet to track the growth of various crops in the garden.

    During the brainstorming phase for a project idea, he shared the tracker with the team and they all agreed to transform it into a web app. Now with many people turning to kitchen gardens for the daily supplies of healthy vegetables, this app will help them effectively manage their small gardens.
